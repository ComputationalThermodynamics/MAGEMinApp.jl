# This is an example file on how to format bulk-rock composition to be loaded in MAGEMin_app
# Commented lines start with '#'
# Spaces before/after ";" do not matter
# make sure the header line "title; comments; db; sysUnit; oxide; frac" is provided as first uncommented line
# column titles order in the header does not matter as long as the same order is respected for the bulk-rock list
# Bulks provided with unit "wt" will be automatically converted and displayed in mol faction (normalized to 1)
# Note that either [..., Fe2O3, FeO,...] or [..., FeO, O, ...] must me provided
# Database to be used should be provided (ig, igd, mp, mb, um, alk), 
# if you want the bulk to appear in more than one database duplicate it and adjust the oxides/fractions
#
# P,T-X bulk-rock composition:
#-----------------------------
# if you want to load two bulks for P-X or T-X diagrams simply add a second bulk after the first one (first bulk = left bound, second bulk = right bound)
# Once the bulk-rock composition file is loaded in MAGEMin_app, make sure you select your bulk for the left and right table!
